I am an AI & Social Scientist looking to build moral alignment into AI. Currently studying this in agent-based simulation (e.g. Multi-Agent RL with independent learners) and foundation models (e.g. Llama), with inspiration from moral philosophy, psychology and economics. 

Currently I'm a PhD candidate at the [Machine Intelligence Lab](https://www.machineintelligencelab.ai/), Department of Computer Science, University College London (UCL). I am conducting my PhD research on the problem of Morality - in humans and machines - funded by the Leverhulme Doctoral Training Programme for the Ecological Study of the Brain. Before my PhD I studied Psychology & Linguistics (@ UCL), conducted research on political psychology using Twitter data (@ Cambridge), and worked as an AI/Data Scientist and Behavioural Scientist at two start-ups and a large investment bank. 

My research combines Artificial Intelligence with Moral Philosophy and Social Psychology. I use simulation methods, Reinforcement Learning, Game Theory and Language Models to 1) study the emergence of ethical and cooperative behaviour in multi-agent social dilemma environments, and 2) provide insights for developing morality for real-world, interactive learning & decision-making AI systems in the future. My latest project has focused on analysing multi-agent interactions between learning artificial agents that differ in their moral objective functions, trying to generate insights for behaviours and social outcomes that emerge in morally heterogeneous societies.

I'm in the process of changing my last name from Karmannaya to Tennant. If you see different names listed on different publications, don't get confused :)
