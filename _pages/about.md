I am an AI & Behavioural Scientist looking to combine my interests in computational modelling, data science and human behaviour in solving prominent challenges. 

Currently I'm a PhD candidate at the [Machine Intelligence Lab](https://www.machineintelligencelab.ai/), Department of Computer Science, University College London (UCL). I am conducting my PhD research on the problem of Ethics - in humans and machines - funded by the Leverhulme Doctoral Training Programme for the Ecological Study of the Brain. 

My research combines Artificial Intelligence and Moral Philosophy. I use simulation methods, Reinforcement Learning and Game Theory to study the emergence of ethical and cooperative behaviour in individuals and groups. Currently I am focusing on the study of learning through dyadic interactions in social dilemma environments. I analyse Multi-Agent interactions between learning artificial agents that differ in their moral objective functions, trying to generate insights for behaviours and social outcomes that emerge in morally heterogeneous societies.

I'm in the process of changing my last name from Karmannaya to Tennant. If you see different names listed on different publications, don't get confused :)
