I am an AI Scientist + Social Scientist looking to build moral alignment _into_ AI agents. At the moment I am studying this using multi-agent simulations with independent learning agents, using systems based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) and foundation models (LLMs such as the Gemma2 model), with inspiration from moral philosophy, psychology and game theory. 

Currently I'm a final-year PhD candidate at the [Machine Intelligence Lab](https://www.machineintelligencelab.ai/), Department of Computer Science, University College London (UCL). I am funded by the Leverhulme Doctoral Training Programme for the Ecological Study of the Brain. Before my PhD I studied Psychology & Linguistics (@ UCL), conducted research on political psychology using Twitter data (@ University of Cambridge), and worked as an AI/Data Scientist and Behavioural Scientist at two start-ups and a large investment bank. 

In my latest work I have developed a methodology for quantifying key moral philosophical frameworks in terms of actions and consequences on an envoronment, used these as intrinsic rewards for training RL agents (see [IJCAI'23 paper](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2023/36)), studied the emergence of ethical and cooperative behaviours in multi-agent social dilemma environments, exploring population dynamics in morally heterogeneous artificial societies of learning agents (see [AIES'24 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04202)), and applied this framework to fine-tuning LLM agents to play more morally aligned policies in interactive game environments (see [pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01639)).
