I was invited to teach 1-2 lectures per year, for three consecutive years (2021 - 2023), on the ‘Language and Communication’ module on the UCL BSc Psychology & Language Sciences programme. My lectures covered computaitonal analysis of language in the real world, including topics on Natural Language Processing / representation techniques, collecting data from social media APIs (e.g. Twitter), creating variables from this messy data, and my own research in Political Psychology and Linguistics on Twitter. In 2023 I added optional material on more recent developments such as Neural Networks for NLP, and the techniques underlying large language models such as the one used in ChatGPT. 

Materials: to be uploaded.
