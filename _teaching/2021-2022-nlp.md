I was invited to teach 1-2 lectures per year, for three consecutive years (2021 - 2023), on the ‘Language and Communication’ module on the UCL BSc Psychology & Language Sciences programme. My lectures covered:
- computaitonal analysis of language in the real world (e.g. on social media sites)
- collecting data from social media APIs (e.g. Twitter), creating variables from this messy data, and my own research in Political Psychology and Linguistics on Twitter. 
- topics on Natural Language Processing / representation techniques
- In 2023 I added material on more recent developments such as Neural Networks for NLP, and the techniques underlying Large Language Models such as the one used in ChatGPT.
