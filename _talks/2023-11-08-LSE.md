Gave a long talk about the intersections of AI and Social Science to a group of students from the LSE - Psychology Society, Philosophy Society, Effective Altruism Society & Google Developer Society. I talked about the methodologies behind NLP and how social scientstis can use them, and then about what social scientists can bring into AI Research in the domain of moral alignment, with specific examples from our paper 'Modeling Moral Choies in Social Dilemmas with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning'.
