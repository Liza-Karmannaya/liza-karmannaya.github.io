Gave a 1-hr talk dsicussing **Moral Alignment for Agentic AI Systems**. In this talk I discussed agency in AI, existing approaches to Alignment (as described in [our preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01818)), and my work on training or fine-tuning RL and LLM agents with intrinsic rewards, with particular focus on the unexpected findings from our papers at [IJCAI'23](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2023/36), [AIES'24](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AIES/article/view/31736) and [ICLR'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01639).
