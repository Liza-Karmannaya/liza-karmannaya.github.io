As part of UCL's annual NeuroAI conference, I gave a lightning talk introducing the approaches to developing morality in AI (see [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01818) for the overall framework), and overviewed our work form IJCAI 2023 paper implementing philosophically-inspired intrinsic rewards for RL agents as an example.
